# My Zootopia

**My Zootopia** is a Python-based application that prompts users for an animal name, retrieves information about that animal from the [API-NINJAS](https://api-ninjas.com/) API, and dynamically generates an HTML file based on a pre-defined template. This HTML file provides a structured display of animal information, making it easy to explore various species.
